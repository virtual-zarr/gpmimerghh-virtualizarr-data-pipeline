# GPM IMERG HH Virtual Icechunk Store Design Doc

## Overview

This document describes a cloud pipeline that builds a virtual Icechunk store covering the [GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 Half Hourly 0.1° × 0.1° V07 (GPM_3IMERGHH)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPM_3IMERGHH_07/summary) dataset.

## Goals

- Produce a single analysis-ready cloud-optimized (ARCO) data cube spanning the full GPM_3IMERGHH dataset record (1998-01-01 to 2025-09-30).
- Use `virtualizarr-data-pipelines` (SQS + Lambda) for parallel virtual-reference generation + commit to icechunk.
- Keep individual chunk manifests under a reasonable size for opening in-memory (~500MB) by using [Icechunk manifest splitting](https://icechunk.io/en/stable/guides/performance/#splitting-manifests) to make `xr.open_zarr(...)` cheap regardless of total dataset size.
- Use Zarr region writing to enable unsequenced parallelism to virtualize the entire dataset.

## Non-goals

At time of writing, it is _not_ a goal to create an ongoing icechunk store using the late or early run GPM IMERG product. This may change if it is determined such an ongoing dataset would be useful to users (see [original Github request](https://github.com/MAAP-Project/Community/issues/1281)).

The [first FAQ on this page](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) describes the different (final, early, and late) GPM IMERG products.

## About the dataset

- Official name: **GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 Half Hourly 0.1° × 0.1° V07 (GPM_3IMERGHH)** at GES DISC.
- S3 bucket: `s3://gesdisc-cumulus-prod-protected/GPM_L3/GPM_3IMERGHH.07/` (us-west-2, NASA requester-pays via Earthdata STS).
- One HDF5 file per 30-min interval, 48 files/day, 486,480 files through September 2025.

## Single granule structure

![Single granule cube](diagrams/single_file_cube.svg)

Each HDF5 file contains a `Grid` group (plus a `Grid/Intermediate` group that is dropped). The Grid group has dimensions `(time=1, lon=3600, lat=1800)` and the variables below. The cube view above shows the lon-chunking of the 24-chunk variables on the front face — the 12-chunk array (`probabilityLiquidPrecipitation`) chunks the same axis half as finely.

| variable | dtype | shape | chunk shape | num chunks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| precipitation | float32 | (1, 3600, 1800) | (1, 145, 1800) | 24 |
| randomError | float32 | (1, 3600, 1800) | (1, 145, 1800) | 24 |
| precipitationQualityIndex | float32 | (1, 3600, 1800) | (1, 145, 1800) | 24 |
| probabilityLiquidPrecipitation | int16 | (1, 3600, 1800) | (1, 291, 1800) | 12 |
| time | int32 | (1,) | (32,) | (loaded natively) |
| lon | float32 | (3600,) | (3600,) | (loaded natively) |
| lat | float32 | (1800,) | (1800,) | (loaded natively) |
| time_bnds, lon_bnds, lat_bnds | — | small | small | (loaded natively) |

**Per file:** `24 + 24 + 24 + 12 = 84 virtual chunks`, 6 coordinate / bounds arrays.

## Dataset Characteristics

**Fill Values:**

There are 2 fill value concepts for HDF5 virtual zarr datasets. They are well-detailed [in this VirtualiZarr documentation](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/custom_parsers.html#fill-values). The first concept, the "value for uninitialized chunks - (e.g., Zarr fill_value)", is typically parsed from the HDF5 `fill_value` attribute. This attribute is not set on GPM_3IMERGHH files. A fallback has been introduced in VirtualiZarr but not yet released. That is why, at time of writing, this repository uses the `virtualizarr[hdf] @ git+https://github.com/zarr-developers/virtualizarr.git@fix/problem_fillvalues` branch of VirtualiZarr.

The second fill value concept, the "sentinel value - (e.g., CF _FillValue ))" is present on the HDF5 datasets via its attributes. For example, `_FillValue` and `CodeMissingValue` are present on the `precipitation` HDF5 dataset as `-9999.9`.

## Dropped variables and stored variables

* **Dropped:** `Intermediate`, `nv`, `lonv`, `latv` — not useful at the analysis-ready cube level.
* **Native:** `time`, `lon`, `lat` plus bounds (`time_bnds`, `lon_bnds`, `lat_bnds`) are stored as native Zarr arrays so opening the dataset doesn't pay to materialize coords through virtual refs. These are handled differently in Stage 0 vs Stage 2: Stage 0 writes them at full length *before* any region is written; Stage 2 region writes leave them alone.

## Final virtual Icechunk store

![Final store long cube](diagrams/full_store_cube.svg)

Conceptually the store is one root group with:

- **Four virtual data arrays**, each of shape `(time: 486480, lon: 3600, lat: 1800)`. Chunks are virtual referents to a byte range of an HDF5 file on GES DISC's S3.
- **Native coordinate arrays.** `time` is the only sizable one — 486,480 int64 values, rechunked to 17,520 per chunk (one year per chunk) so coord reads stay cheap. `lon` and `lat` are single small chunks.

Per data array:

```
number of chunks for each precipitation, randomError, precipitationQualityIndex = 486,480 × 24 = 11,675,520
number of chunks for probabilityLiquidPrecipitation = 486,480 × 12 = 5,679,936

total virtual chunks = 40,864,320
```

## Manifest sharding strategy

This is a lesson [from the store created with icechunk v1 over a year ago](https://github.com/earth-mover/icechunk-nasa/blob/main/design-docs/icechunk-stores.md): a single monolithic manifest does not scale. At 11 years of data, v1 produced a ~3 GB manifest that had to be fully downloaded on every open and every append.

**Strategy.** Split manifests 1 per year per array. Use the chunk position along `time`, with one shard per year. NB: This split will not be perfectly aligned with years because of leap years.

```python
import icechunk as ic

splitting = ic.ManifestSplittingConfig(
    split_sizes={
        "precipitation":                  {"time": 17520},
        "randomError":                    {"time": 17520},
        "precipitationQualityIndex":      {"time": 17520},
        "probabilityLiquidPrecipitation": {"time": 17520},
    }
)
preload = ic.ManifestPreloadConfig(max_total_refs=0)  # don't eagerly load data manifests

config = ic.RepositoryConfig.default()
config.manifest = ic.ManifestConfig(splitting=splitting, preload=preload)
```

This produces:

**TODO:** Verify the 3rd and 4th bullet below.

- **28 shards per array × 4 arrays = 112 data manifests.**
- ~420,480 refs per shard (17520 timesteps × 24 lon-chunks).
- Roughly **80–200 MB per shard** in Icechunk 2.x's Arrow-style manifest format.
- A small, separately-stored coordinate manifest (<10 MB).

**Why this works.** Opening the store with `xr.open_zarr` only needs the array metadata and the coordinate manifest. Reading a slice loads exactly the shard(s) covering that time range, in parallel. Appending a new year touches one shard per array, not the whole record.

**Critical**: Splitting must be set on the `RepositoryConfig` *before the first write*. If you ever need to retrofit, `rewrite_manifests` lets you re-split an existing repo at the cost of one rewrite.

# Cloud architecture: `virtualizarr-data-pipelines`

## Why `virtualizarr-data-pipelines`

Generating this store means writing references for ~40 million chunks. `virtualizarr-data-pipelines` (VDP) solves three issues that come with that scale:

1. **Snapshot explosion.** A naive one-commit-per-day cadence produces ~10,000 snapshots. VDP runs scheduled garbage collection so we can keep that under control. Final files-per-commit is TBD.
2. **Concurrency + batching.** VDP exposes `MAX_CONCURRENCY` and `SQS_BATCH_SIZE`, which together reduce total commit count and the odds of write conflicts.
3. **Failure retries.** Failed batches go to a DLQ with redrive and structured logging.

## Knobs

* `GARBAGE_COLLECTION_FREQUENCY`: Freguency in days to run garbage collection.
* `SQS_BATCH_SIZE`: The maximum number of records to send to the function in each batch ([ref](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/lambda/latest/dg/services-sqs-configure.html))

## Why region writes (instead of append)

GPM_3IMERGHH filenames are **deterministic** (see [`helpers.url_for`](./notebooks/helpers.py)) — each file maps to exactly one time index, computable from the filename alone. Workers can write refs in in any order. Region writes are also idempotent on retry, whereas serial `append_dim` writes have to track ordering to avoid skipped or duplicated indices.

## Three-stage pipeline

```

### Stage 0 — Initialize

[`template_repo.py`](template_repo.py) defines `initialize_repo()`, which becomes the `Processor.initialize_repo` method in `virtualizarr_processor.processor`. VDP calls it from both the [trigger-once initialize handler](https://github.com/developmentseed/virtualizarr-data-pipelines/blob/main/lambda/initialize/handler.py) ([trigger-once custom resource](https://github.com/developmentseed/virtualizarr-data-pipelines/blob/main/cdk/stack.py#L157-L178)) and the per-batch `process_messages` handler. The function is idempotent (`_is_initialized` checks the commit ancestry), so only the first invocation actually writes the template.

### Stage 1 — Dispatch messages to the queue

A one-off script enumerates the timestamps (no listing required — see "Why region writes" above) and pushes messages in the format VDP's [`process_notification`](https://github.com/developmentseed/virtualizarr-data-pipelines/blob/main/lambda/process_messages/handler.py#L21-L42) handler expects. Standard S3 Inventory isn't an option since we don't own the source bucket.

**TODO:** Write and test the dispatch script.

### Stage 2 — Region writes

The batch loop is handled by Powertools' [`BatchProcessor`](https://fiserv.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/develop/utilities/batch/) ([see VDP usage](https://github.com/developmentseed/virtualizarr-data-pipelines/blob/main/lambda/process_messages/handler.py#L17)) with `SQS_BATCH_SIZE` files per Lambda. Region writes don't need ordering within a batch.

**TODO:** Wire [`write_day.py`](./write_day.py)'s `process_file` into `virtualizarr_processor.processor`.

## Additional Requirements

### Earthdata Auth

The NASA bucket needs short-lived S3 credentials via `https://data.gesdisc.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3credentials`, which authorizes via Earthdata Login credentials. Inside the lambda:

- Store `EARTHDATA_USERNAME` / `EARTHDATA_PASSWORD` in Lambda env vars (sourced from Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store at deploy time).
- Each Lambda calls `NasaEarthdataCredentialProvider(credentials_url)` to fetch its own STS creds. Don't pass STS creds in as task arguments — they expire in ~1 hour and the full job will run longer than that.
- Use the *icechunk-side* `s3_refreshable_credentials(get_credentials=...)` so refreshes happen automatically inside icechunk too.

### Failure handling

Region writes are *idempotent* — re-running a file overwrites the same chunk refs with the same byte ranges. Failed batches land in VDP's DLQ; retry == redrive.

### Validation

Validate after building by scanning for any timesteps that have an average of the Zarr fill value.

## Memory budget

| stage | workload | peak memory per worker |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 0 — Initialize Repo | One process, builds the 486,480-element time array, opens one sample granule for metadata, writes coord arrays | < 500 MB |
| Stage 1 — Dispatch | Iterates ~486k timestamps, builds URLs, sends SQS messages in batches. No HDF5 reads, no virtual refs in memory. | < 128 MB |
| Stage 2 — Region writes (VDP) | `SQS_BATCH_SIZE` files × 84 virtual refs each, plus icechunk session state for the batch's commit. At batch size 48 ≈ 4,032 refs. | < 1 GB (2 GB Lambda is comfortable) |

## Fallback: staged + serial commits

If `virtualizarr.to_icechunk(..., region=...)` doesn't work as advertised, fall back to writing data serially, using `virtualizarr.to_icechunk(..., append_dim="time")`.

## Implementation sequence

Following the TODOs listed above:

- [ ] **Single-Lambda dry run:** One Lambda writes one day's 48 refs into a fresh repo with splitting configured. Open with `xr.open_zarr` and verify.
- [ ] **Year-scale:** run all of 1998 (~365 Lambdas), measure per-shard manifest size, validate read latency on a random slice.
- [ ] **Concurrency stress:** run 5,000 Lambdas concurrently (5 years) and confirm the merge step holds up.
- [ ] **Full build:** all 486k files.
- [ ] **Validation:** scan for fill-value-heavy slices indicating failed writes; spot-check 100 random chunks against original HDF5 byte ranges.
- [ ] **Read-performance benchmark:** time-series at a point, global mean at a single timestep, regional subset over 1 year. Compare vs. opening individual HDF5 files.
- [ ] **(Future)** Batch rechunk virtual → native Icechunk for read-heavy use cases. Use the virtual store as the source.
